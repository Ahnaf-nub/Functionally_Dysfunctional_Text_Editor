# Functionally Dysfunctional Text Editor

**Functionally Dysfunctional Text Editor** is a quirky, sentiment-aware text editor that adds a fun twist to saving files. It analyzes the sentiment of your text, detects programming languages for code files, and even makes you play a mini-game before saving! The editor also supports dark mode, word counting, and random text insertions during saves.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of your text and gives feedback.
- **Programming Language Detection**: Automatically detects and saves files with the correct extension for Python, C, Arduino, and C++ code.
- **Save file**: A mini-game where you have to click button for five times has to be completed before your file is saved.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Word Count**: Real-time word counting to keep track of your progress.
