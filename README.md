# Functionally Dysfunctional Text Editor

It is a quirky, sentiment-aware text editor that adds a fun twist to saving files. It analyzes the sentiment of your text, detects programming languages for code files, and even makes you play a mini-game before saving! The editor also supports dark mode, word counting, and random text insertions during saves.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of your text and gives feedback.
- **Programming Language Detection**: Automatically detects and saves files with the correct extension. Currently supported are Python, C, Arduino, and C++ code.
- **Save file**: A mini-game where you have to click button for five times has to be completed before your file is saved. After saving it will show some random phrases that will be scattered around, though it will not save that texts into the file.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Word Count**: Real-time word counting to keep track of your progress.
